# Liscence plate region detection
A machine learning project using TensorFlow and deep learning to detect the bounding box area of license plates in images. Built for an automotive-themed, focusing on object detection techniques without full text recognition.

WEEK 1
1. **On monday 27-10-2025:** I figured out the project title
2. **On tuesday 28-10-2025:** I installed all required libraries using pip, set up project folder structure
3. **On wednesday 29-10-2025:** Researched on UFPR-ALPR dataset documentation and understand the dataset structure(images + XML annotations)
4. **On thursday 30-10-2025:** Visualize 20-30 random samples and identify any problematic images
5. **On friday 31-10-2025:** Split data into train (70%), validation (15%), test (15%)

WEEK 2
1. **On monday 03-11-2025:** I prepared a CNN architecture and understanding about model compilation
2. **On tuesday 04-11-2025:** I tranined my project.
3. **On wednesday 05-11-2025:** I trained model with ~50 epochs, loss curves plotted, model checkpoint saved.
4. **On thursday 06-11-2025:** Fix the problems generated and License plate region extraction.
5. **On friday 07-11-2025:** A complete working system tested on real images with IoU evaluation.
